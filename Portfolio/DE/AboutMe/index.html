        Hello, I am a 17-year-old youth born in Veracruz, Mexico on the date of 12/11/2006. I am specializing in cybersecurity through YouTube videos as well as online courses. The operating system I use is Kali Linux; before, I used Parrot. Currently, I am learning to use Python for offensive purposes. My current hobbies are playing video games with my friends and, when I am alone, I like to learn more about cybersecurity, such as taking courses or watching a video on the subject. My current interest is to finish CsBe school with good grades and learn more about cybersecurity, as well as, find my first job in computing and start my independent life. If you are wondering how my passion for cybersecurity started because I am mentioning it a lot, I will explain it as best as possible. I started to like cybersecurity when I first watched the Mr. Robot series in 2016 when I was 10 years old. From there, I searched the internet and YouTube on how to do what they do in the movie. Clearly, on YouTube, I found many videos and found a cybersecurity YouTuber named Savitar. At that moment, I discovered Parrot Security OS and started little by little. I started with TryHackMe and then moved on to HackTheBox and a few months later, I switched to Kali Linux OS, which at that moment I fell in love with. It seemed awesome in a nutshell; I discovered a new world and at that moment is when I would spend about 5 hours a day just doing VMs, and now I don't spend so much time because the CsBe school is consuming a lot of my time and energy. But still, in my free time, like weekends or vacations, I continue doing VMs. I have not obtained many certificates because I do not have enough money and I want to buy them with my money and not my parents'. But for now, I have obtained 1 certificate that could be seen in the "Certificate" section. Well, that is my story in Cyber Security in "a few words".
